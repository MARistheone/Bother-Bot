# 🤖 Bother Bot — How It Works

Welcome to the accountability server! I am here to make sure you get your stuff done, or shame you if you don't. Here is everything you need to know:

**🎫 Getting Started**
Use `/opt-in` in any channel to register. I will create a private task channel just for you.

**📝 Adding Tasks**
Use `/task add` to create a task. You can use natural language for the due date (e.g., 'tomorrow', 'next friday', 'Oct 15'). If you don't set one, it defaults to tomorrow.

**🎮 The Game (Points)**
🟢 **Complete a task:** +10 points
⏳ **Snooze a task:** -2 points
🔴 **Overdue task:** -5 points (per day!)

**📢 Board & Consequences**
- Your score and active tasks are tracked on the `#accountability-board` in real-time.
- Snoozed tasks are publicly called out in `#the-meat-grinder` channel.
- At 9 PM ET every day, anyone with pending or overdue tasks goes on the **Wall of Shame**.
- Anyone can use `/prod @user [task]` to mock you about an active task.
